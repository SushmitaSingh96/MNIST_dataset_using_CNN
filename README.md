# MNIST_dataset_using_CNN
MNIST is a dataset containing handwritten images of digits from 0 to 9. Here I have built a CNN to train a model to predict the digit from the image as CNNs are really good at detecting patterns in images. 
I have used convolutional layers, maxpooling layers, a flatten layer and dense and dropout layers in the model. I have used Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function to complie the model.
Number of epochs to fit the data to our model = 10.
